<h4>A propos de microbitcoin.net</h4>
    <p>The site is a showcase for e-commerce professionals to demonstrate how much easier a bitcoin checkout process can be compared to a traditionnal bank card online checkout. I have developped this site in my spare time as a service to the community. I am also one of the co-founders of paymium.com, author of "Bitcoin Book" (in French, English translation is in the works) and of several articles. Links can be found on my <a href="http://www.e-ducat.fr" style="color:rgb(0,0,0);" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>

    <h4>Why you should find microbitcoin.net interesting?</h4>

	<h4>How to pay with Bitcoin?</h4>
    <p>Again, no need to spend your hard earned bitcoins.Use any Bitcoin wallet, e.g.: electrum (desktop), mycelium (Android) or hot wallet (iOS). Then send me an email using the one you signed up with,  requesting a full refund.</p>
